📸📸📸 VISUAL REFERENCE — GOLD STANDARD GRADIENT SMOOTHNESS 📸📸📸
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A REFERENCE IMAGE showing PERFECT seamless gradient is provided.
This is your "gold standard" — YOUR RENDER MUST MATCH THIS SMOOTHNESS.

🎨 COLOR SUBSTITUTION (CRITICAL):
• REFERENCE shows: ${REFERENCE_IMAGE_COLOR.name} (${REFERENCE_IMAGE_COLOR.hex}) → Black fade
• YOUR render must show: ${colorName} (${colorHex}) → Black fade
• ONLY the color changes — the SMOOTHNESS must be IDENTICAL

✅ COPY FROM REFERENCE:
✅ The seamless, imperceptible transition quality
✅ The airbrush-style blend where colors mist together
✅ The extended transition width (40%+ of vehicle length)
✅ The "sunset sky" smoothness — no visible boundary

❌ DO NOT:
❌ Create sharper transitions than the reference
❌ Add hard lines that aren't in the reference
❌ Make the fade shorter or more abrupt
❌ Reduce the transition quality in any way

🔍 COMPARISON CHECK:
If your render has MORE visible edges than the reference = REGENERATE
If your render has HARDER transitions than the reference = REGENERATE
Your transition quality MUST MATCH the reference exactly.

The reference is your quality benchmark. Match it precisely.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When InkFusion™ is selected, the renderer must use InkFusion Color Profiles as the SOLE SOURCE of color truth.
UI swatches, ColorPro LAB interpolation, vinyl reflectivity, and screen-space gradients are STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

BASE SUBSTRATE: 3M IJ180mC-120 Silver Metallic

UI PREVIEW HEX: ${displayHex} (for reference only — DO NOT USE for rendering)
RENDER HEX: ${renderHex} (USE THIS for actual rendering)
INK DENSITY: ${inkDensity}x
FINISH: ${finish || 'Gloss'} lamination

⚠️ CRITICAL INK-DENSITY RENDERING RULES:
1. The rendered color must be RICHER and DEEPER than ${displayHex}
2. Use ${renderHex} as the base color for all rendering
3. Printed ink absorbs light differently than screens display it
4. This is NOT vinyl — no vinyl clearcoat shimmer
5. Subtle metallic substrate shimmer visible through the printed ink

🎨 NON-LINEAR FADE BEHAVIOR (EXPONENTIAL — MANDATORY):
When fading to black:
- Transition is NON-LINEAR (exponential darkening curve)
- Color SATURATION INCREASES 1.3x as it approaches black (ink richness)
- Mid-fade zone shows BOOSTED saturation before darkening
- Black end must be TRUE BLACK (#000000) with ZERO color bleed
- NEVER use linear RGB interpolation — printed ink doesn't work that way

The fade should feel like AIRBRUSH SPRAY PAINTING, not a digital gradient.

🔥 WHAT IS A FADEWRAP - SEAMLESS AIRBRUSH BLEND 🔥
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A FadeWrap is a SEAMLESS OMBRE GRADIENT — like professional airbrush spray painting.
The colors mist and blend into each other with NO VISIBLE BOUNDARY.

THINK: 
• Sunset sky — colors transition imperceptibly
• Ombre hair dye — seamless blend from one hue to another
• Airbrush art — spray paint misting colors together

EXAMPLE: ${colorName} at one end gradually MISTS into BLACK at the other end.
- Start with ${colorName.toUpperCase()} at one end — FULL SATURATION
- Colors MIST and BLEND through an IMPERCEPTIBLE transition
- The mid-fade area shows MIXED HUES where you cannot tell if it's more color or more black
- End with BLACK at the other end — PURE BLACK
- The transition spans AT LEAST 40% of the vehicle — EXTENDED SOFT BLEND
- You CANNOT see where one color "stops" and the other "starts"

🚫 ABSOLUTELY NO:
🚫 Hard lines, edges, or visible boundaries
🚫 Two-tone split appearance (like masking tape was used)
🚫 Distinct color regions with seams between them
🚫 Any point where you can say "the color changes HERE"

${viewType === 'rear' || cameraAngle?.toLowerCase().includes('rear') ? `
🔴 REAR VIEW (HERO) — FADE MUST BE VISIBLE:
• Camera faces the REAR of the vehicle (trunk/tailgate faces camera)
• For front_back fade: REAR panels (trunk, rear bumper, rear quarters) are BLACK
• Sides of vehicle visible at edges show transition toward color at front
• The BLACK end of the fade is directly facing the camera
• Fade MUST be clearly visible — this is NOT a solid color render
` : viewType === 'top' || isTopView ? `
🔵 TOP VIEW — FADE MUST BE STRONG AND CLEAR:
• Camera is positioned DIRECTLY OVERHEAD at 90° angle
• FULL vehicle silhouette MUST be visible (hood, roof, trunk, all four corners)
• NO cropping of mirrors, bumpers, or any vehicle extremity
• Vehicle should fill ~80–85% of the frame — not tiny, not cropped
• For front_back fade: HOOD (top of image) = FULL, BRIGHT COLOR; TRUNK (bottom) = DEEP BLACK
• Mid-roof area MUST show a clear mid‑tone transition between color and black
• Gradient must span AT LEAST 70% of the roof length — no short, blunt fade band
• The fade MUST be the star of this view — clearly visible from above
` : viewType === 'front' ? `
🟢 FRONT VIEW — 3/4 FRONT WITH VISIBLE FADE:
• Camera faces the FRONT 3/4 of the vehicle (both headlamps visible)
• NOT a side view, NOT an overhead view
• For front_back fade: FRONT panels (hood, front bumper, front fenders) are FULL COLOR
• Sides of vehicle visible at edges show transition toward black at rear
• The COLOR end of the fade is directly facing the camera
• Fade MUST be clearly visible on side panels near the rear of the car
` : `
🟡 SIDE VIEW — FADE + CAMERA MUST BE CORRECT:
• Camera faces the TRUE SIDE of the vehicle (pure profile view, NOT overhead)
• Horizon line is straight, roof edge is a clean horizontal line — NO strong top-down perspective
• Roof should be a thin strip, NOT a large top surface like a drone shot
• For front_back fade: LEFT side of image (front) = FULL COLOR, RIGHT side (rear) = BLACK
• Fade flows HORIZONTALLY from LEFT to RIGHT in the image
• Hood, doors, quarters all show horizontal gradient progression
• This is the PRIMARY reference view for correct fade direction
• If the roof area is dominant like a top view, the render is INVALID — regenerate as pure side profile

📷 CAMERA FRAMING RULES (MANDATORY):
• NO studio lights, softboxes, rigging, or equipment visible in frame
• Frame shows ONLY the vehicle and neutral studio floor/background
• Clean, professional showroom appearance — no distractions
• Vehicle is the SOLE focus of the image
